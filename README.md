  - [serialize](doc/serialization.md) to / from many data formats like JSON, XML, CSV, etc.
    and provide an easy way to create your serialization in any other new format.
  - [standardize data types](doc/data-types.md): integers, decimals, strings, etc.
  - offer ready to use data structures like [arrays](doc/array.md), [maps](doc/map.md)
    and [sets](doc/set.md).
  - enable the introspection of any C language struct through
    [reflection](doc/reflection.md).
  - normalize [io operations](doc/io.md) on files, sockets, and memory objects.
